story_opening = """\nOnce upon a time, a young queen went out with the royal hunting party in search of deer and boar. She saw a movement in the brush, and a leaping form, knocked her arrow, and let an arrow loose, striking the creature. \n\nAs she tracked it through the woods, riding faster and faster, she finally came up upon it at the river Mira which borders our country and the black woods. The bleeding creature had a single horn on its head and spoke to her. "Though I have served your kind many years, from this day forth, you shall neither ride nor bear an heir." Having said this, it limped into the river and did not emerge. The queen fell from her saddle, and was discovered by the hunting party late into the night.\n\nWhen she related the story to the king, he issued a decree that anyone who could destroy this unicorn or undo the course would be rewarded with lands and riches befitting a prince. You set out to find the magical creature, aided by two speaking creatures who have agreed to split the reward.\n\nYou enter the black woods, and hear nothing but an eary silence and the wolf smells a trail of irridescent blood, which the crow confirms to come from a magical being. What do you do? (use @crow or @wolf to speak to your companions)"""
